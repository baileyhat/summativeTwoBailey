       <p>Scandinavian design is a design movement characterized by simplicity, minimalism and functionality that emerged in the early 20th century, and subsequently flourished in the 1950s throughout the five Nordic countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. SID was created by Margo Delista who has always had a love and passion for interior design. She wanted to create an event that would bring people who love Scandinavian design together. SID aims to inspre people. We want people to meet the minds behind the design.  A place where people can come and see the latest and greatest ideas from creatives working with Scandinavian Interior Design.</p>

        <p> Margo grew up in Kerikeri, New Zealand. She is 32 and married to Keeley Delista. Growing up her mother was an interior designer and Margo was sure she was going to follow in her mothers footsteps. That was until she came across the magazine in her mothers office that said “Scandinavian Interior Design” when she asked her mum what it was her mothr replied  with  “not many people know about that kind of design.” Margo couldnt belive this minimalistic and  harmonious design was not used across the world. And that’s where the very first idea of SID came about.</p>
